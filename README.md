# Primus Frontend
This project has three parts. 
## Login:
The main page has a login form in order to login to the website with password field.
Username: user@example.com
Password: password
## Password Reset: 
The second part of the project is the password reset page. Main page has an option available to reset the password if the user has forgotten the password. After clicking on that option the user is sent to another page where user can write his email address in order to get the link to reset the password.
## Dashboard:
If the user inputs the right username and password then he is sent to another page which is dedicated for the dashboard. Which can be customized according to the needs.
### Styling:
I have created a globals.css file which applies styles to all the components (login, reset password, and dashboard).
